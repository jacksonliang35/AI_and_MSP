run.m
This file is the main function of this MP.

Frames=run(datadir);

datadir is the directory of all files.

warping.m
This file perform image warping by affine transformation.

[frame,CT] = warping(inVert,newVert,Triangles,Img)

inVert is the mesh vertices matrix of slience image
newVert is the transformed mesh vertices matrix generated by function interpVert.
Trangles is a matrix that relate mesh vertices to mesh trangles.
Img is the slience image.
The function will return frame, which is deformed images in greyscale.

generate_movie.m

Generate video of saved frames. Only works in windows system.

ECE417_MP5_AV_Data.mat

This file has four variables:

(1) av_train is the training audio-visual data.
    av_train.audio is the audio feature matrix. 
    Each column av_train.audio(:,k) represents the audio feature 
    vector of frame k.
    av_train.visual is the visual feature matrix. 
    Each column av_train.visual(:,k) represents the visual feature 
    vector of frame k.

(2) av_validate is the audio-visual data for validation.
    av_validate.audio is the audio feature matrix. 
    Each column av_validate.audio(:,k) represents the audio feature 
    vector of frame k.
    av_validate.visual is the visual feature matrix. 
    Each column av_validate.visual(:,k) represents the visual feature 
    vector of frame k.

(3) testAudio is the test audio data matrix. Each column of testAudio
    is an audio feature vector.

(4) silenceModel will be used to decide if an audio frame is silence.
