# ECE417 (Multimedia Signal Processing)

This directory contains projects and reports for ECE417. Note that the data is omitted.

### MP Descriptions
* [MP1](./MP/MP1)
In MP1, we approximated a similarity measure using a metric learning technique. We updated the weight matrix for each photo after each round of user input.

See MP1 report [here](./Report/ECE417_MP1_report.pdf).

* [MP2](./MP/MP2)
In MP2, we performed image classification using k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), after dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We also compared results from different hyper-parameters (i.e. k, PCA energy, ...).

See MP2 report [here](./Report/ECE417_MP2_report.pdf).

* [MP3](./MP/MP3)
In MP3, we performed audio classification using kNN. We experimented with different audio features (i.e. Cepstrum coefficient & MFCC) and compared the results.

See MP3 report [here](./Report/ECE417_MP3_report.pdf).

* [MP4](./MP/MP4)
In MP4, we classified person ID through a audio-visual (AV) fusion technique. We trained a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. We compared the accuracy from purely audio and visual features.

See MP4 report [here](./Report/ECE417_MP4_report.pdf).

* [MP5](./MP/MP5)
In MP5, we performed AV fusion speech recognition using Hidden Markov Model (HMM), trained using the forward-backward procedure. Note that we simply added a time series into the previous GMM model.

See MP5 report [here](./Report/ECE417_MP5_report.pdf).

* [MP6](./MP/MP6)
In MP6, we constructed a strong image classifier for face detection from a bunch of weak classifiers, using the Adaboost algorithm. We first extracted Viola-Jones image features and then built a strong classifier upon them.

See MP6 report [here](./Report/ECE417_MP6_report.pdf).

* [MP7](./MP/MP7)
In MP7, we moved from discriminative models towards generative models. We generated the visual transform based on given speech data, after training the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using AV data. We also performed bilinear interpolation in-between mesh points.

See MP7 report [here](./Report/ECE417_MP7_report.pdf).
