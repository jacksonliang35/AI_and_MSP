### MP Descriptions
* [MP1](./MP/LWL_1)
In MP1, we implemented DFS, BFS, greedy, and A-star search algorithms and tested them on mazes of different sizes.

We also designed the heuristics for A-star search in a TSP-like problem, where the agent needs to traverse all the points in the shortest route.

See MP1 report [here](./Report/CS440_MP1_report.pdf).

* [MP2](./MP/LWL_2)
In MP2, we first tackled on constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). We designed a special way of searching the answer to minimize the number of backtrackings.

We also worked on games, where we designed offensive and defensive heuristics in minimax and alpha-beta search.

See MP2 report [here](./Report/CS440_MP2_report.pdf).

* [MP3](./MP/LWL_3)
In MP3, we performed naive Bayes classification on digits and audio waves. We also chose expanded features to classify digits (i.e. using a kernel) and audios (i.e. MFCC).

We also visualize the odds ratio.

See MP3 report [here](./Report/CS440_MP3_report.pdf).

* [MP4](./MP/LWL_4)
In the first part of MP4, we performed digit classification using nearest neighbor.

In the second part, we use the Q-learning method to train a pong playing agent (since the problem is model-free). We also tuned hyper-parameters to optimize our algorithm.
